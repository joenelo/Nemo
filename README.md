# Nemo
This is a remake of Little Nemo the Dream Master.
It is a Level made with tiles from Super Mario World. Bottom to top platformer
The first leve was made with Phaser, a Javascript Library, and was made during my 2nd term of my diploma.

Controls: 

Right Arrow Key = move right,

Left Arrow Key = move left,

Up Arrow Key = jump,

Down Arrow Key = duck,

Spacebar = attack,

Try attacking the different enemies, and their attacks.  Some you can KO and kill, others you might not beable to.

Enjoy
